# DOCKER CHEATSHEET
This is a list of commonly used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) commands for any "Dockerized" app development workflow for developers.

### What's Docker and why use it?
Docker is the world's leading software container platform. Developers use Docker to eliminate the "works on my machine" problems when collaborating on code. Regardless if your OS is Mac, Windows, or a Linux Distro, Docker apps are completely portable and platform agnostic. Docker also manages and tracks changes and dependencies, which makes it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps works.
